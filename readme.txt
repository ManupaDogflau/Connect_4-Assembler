In order to play every player has to select a column, for this
insert a number between 1 and 7.

If the time runs out of time a column is selected at random.

If the column selected is not valid or is full the player would be warned
and asked for another input. The timer would not be reestarted.

If all the board is full the game would be ended in a draw.

The game ends whenever a player makes four in a row. That player wins.
